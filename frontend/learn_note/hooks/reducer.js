// Components with many state updates spread across many event handlers can get overwhelming(áp đảo).
// For these cases, you can consolidate(củng cố) all the state update logic outside your component in a single function,
// called a reducer.

// To reduce complexity and keep all your logic in one easy-to-access place,
// you can move that state logic into a single function outside your component, called a “reducer”.
